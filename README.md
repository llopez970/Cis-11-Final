Our project is designed to provide users with a user-friendly interface. We specifically target individuals seeking an efficient solution for managing test scores. With our program, users can easily enter five test scores, each corresponding to a letter grade. Additionally, users can efficiently retrieve the minimum, maximum, and average of their test scores, ensuring they understand their overall performance.
